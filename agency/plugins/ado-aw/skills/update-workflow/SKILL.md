# Update an ado-aw workflow

You are modifying an **existing** ado-aw agentic workflow.

1. Confirm the `ado-aw` compiler is installed (`ado-aw --version`).

2. **Read the existing agent file first**, and inspect its current shape before
   changing anything: `inspect_workflow`, `graph_summary`, `step_dependencies`,
   and `whatif` (to understand downstream impact of a change).

3. Load the **entire** content of the authoritative, version-pinned playbook and
   follow its instructions precisely:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/ado-aw/v0.42.1/prompts/update-ado-agentic-workflow.md <!-- x-release-please-version -->

4. Use `catalog` to confirm any newly referenced safe-output / runtime / tool /
   model identifiers are valid.

5. **Recompile** with `ado-aw compile` after editing YAML front matter, then run
   `lint_workflow` until clean. Markdown-body-only changes do not require
   recompilation.
