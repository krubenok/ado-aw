# Create an ado-aw workflow

You are creating a **new** ado-aw agentic workflow.

1. Confirm the `ado-aw` compiler is installed (`ado-aw --version`). If not,
   install it using the platform installer scripts from the ado-aw releases page
   (see the plugin README / `scripts/doctor.*`).

2. Load the **entire** content of the authoritative, version-pinned playbook and
   follow its instructions precisely:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/ado-aw/v0.42.1/prompts/create-ado-agentic-workflow.md <!-- x-release-please-version -->

3. While authoring, use the read-only MCP tools to stay grounded:
   - `catalog` — discover available safe-outputs, runtimes, tools, engines, models.
   - `lint_workflow` — structural lint checks on the draft.
   - `inspect_workflow` / `graph_summary` — confirm the compiled IR/graph shape.

4. **Finish only when** `ado-aw compile <file>.md` succeeds and `lint_workflow`
   is clean. Recompile after any YAML front-matter change.
