**Azure DevOps Agentic Workflows.** Write agentic workflows in human-friendly
markdown; ado-aw compiles each into a secure, multi-stage Azure DevOps pipeline
that runs an AI agent in a network-isolated sandbox.

Inspired by [GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw).

## How It Works

You author an **agent file** — a markdown document with YAML front matter that
describes _what_ the agent should do, _when_ it should run, and _which tools_ it
can use. The `ado-aw` compiler transforms that file into a production-ready Azure
DevOps pipeline built around three core security stages:

```
┌────────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐     ┌───────────────────────┐
│  Agent                 │────▶│  Detection           │────▶│  SafeOutputs          │
│  (Stage 1 — Agent)     │     │  (Stage 2 — Threats) │     │  (Stage 3 — Executor) │
│                        │     │                      │     │                       │
│  • Runs inside AWF     │     │  • Reviews proposed  │     │  • Creates PRs        │
│    network sandbox     │     │    actions for safety│     │  • Creates work items │
│  • Read-only ADO token │     │  • Checks for prompt │     │  • Write ADO token    │
│  • Produces safe       │     │    injection, leaks  │     │  • Never exposed to   │
│    output proposals    │     │                      │     │    the agent          │
└────────────────────────┘     └──────────────────────┘     └───────────────────────┘
```

The agent never has direct write access. All mutations (pull requests, work items)
go through a **safe outputs** pipeline where they are threat-analyzed and then
executed with a separate, scoped write token.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Run the first-time installer for your platform:

```bash
# Linux (x64)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/githubnext/ado-aw/releases/latest/download/install-linux.sh | sh

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/githubnext/ado-aw/releases/latest/download/install-macos.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows (x64)
$script = Join-Path $env:TEMP "install-ado-aw.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/githubnext/ado-aw/releases/latest/download/install-windows.ps1" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $script
Get-FileHash $script -Algorithm SHA256
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
& $script
```

The installers download the release binary, verify it against `checksums.txt`, install it to a standard path (`/usr/local/bin` when writable, otherwise a user-local path), and update your PATH when needed.

Compare the `Get-FileHash` output with the `install-windows.ps1` entry in `checksums.txt` before running the script.

If you see `The Process object must have the UseShellExecute property set to false in order to use environment variables`, run the five Windows commands above from an existing PowerShell prompt (not via a nested `powershell -Command ...` launch).

### 2. Initialize Your Repository

```bash
ado-aw init
```

This creates a Copilot agent at `.github/agents/ado-aw.agent.md` that helps you create, update, and debug agentic workflows. The agent automatically downloads the ado-aw compiler and handles compilation.

### 3. Create an Agent with AI

Ask your coding agent (Copilot, Claude, Codex) to create a workflow:

```
Create an ADO agentic workflow using
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/ado-aw/main/prompts/create-ado-agentic-workflow.md

The purpose of the workflow is to check for outdated dependencies weekly
and open PRs to update them.
```

Or if you've run `ado-aw init`, simply ask your AI agent:
```
Create an agentic workflow that checks for outdated dependencies and opens PRs
```

The AI will generate a markdown file like:

```markdown
---
name: "Dependency Updater"
description: "Checks for outdated dependencies and opens PRs"
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: claude-opus-4.7
on:
  schedule: weekly on monday around 9:00
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-22.04
tools:
  azure-devops: true
permissions:
  read: my-read-arm-connection
  write: my-write-arm-connection
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
    target-branch: main
    draft: false
    auto-complete: true
    squash-merge: true
    reviewers:
      - "team-lead@example.com"
---

## Instructions

Check all dependency manifests in this repository. For each outdated
dependency, update it to the latest stable version and create a pull
request with a clear description of what changed and why.
```

### 4. Compile to a Pipeline

```bash
# Simple form — generates a `.lock.yml` alongside the source `.md`
ado-aw compile dependency-updater.md

# Or specify a custom output location
ado-aw compile dependency-updater.md -o path/to/dependency-updater.lock.yml
```

This generates a complete Azure DevOps pipeline YAML file. The compiler also
copies the agent markdown body into the output tree so it's available at runtime.

The compiler also writes/updates a `.gitattributes` file at the repository root
that marks every compiled `.lock.yml` pipeline as `linguist-generated=true merge=ours`,
so GitHub hides them from PR diffs and merge conflicts in generated YAML resolve
to the local copy (which can then be rebuilt with `ado-aw compile`).

### 5. Verify (CI Check)

Ensure pipelines stay in sync with their source:

```bash
ado-aw check dependency-updater.lock.yml
```

This is useful as a CI gate — if someone edits the markdown but forgets to
recompile, the check will fail.

---

## Adding the Pipeline to Azure DevOps

### Step 1: Commit both files

Your repo should contain the agent source `.md` and the compiled pipeline `.lock.yml`.
Place them wherever your team's conventions dictate — there is no required directory structure.

Push both files to your Azure DevOps repository.

### Step 2: Create the pipeline in Azure DevOps

1. Go to **Pipelines → New Pipeline**
2. Select your repository
3. Choose **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file**
4. Point to the compiled `.lock.yml` pipeline file
5. Save (or Save & Run)

### Step 3: Set Up ARM Service Connections for Permissions

This is the most important configuration step. Azure DevOps does not support
fine-grained PAT scoping — tokens are either read or read-write across the
project. To maintain security isolation between the agent and the executor,
**you need two separate ARM service connections**:

#### Why Two Connections?

| | Read Connection | Write Connection |
|---|---|---|
| **Used by** | Stage 1 — the AI agent | Stage 3 — the safe outputs executor |
| **Purpose** | Query ADO APIs (work items, repos, PRs) | Create PRs, work items, link artifacts |
| **Exposed to agent?** | ✅ Yes (inside network sandbox) | ❌ Never |
| **Token variable** | `SC_READ_TOKEN` | `SC_WRITE_TOKEN` |
| **Front matter field** | `permissions.read` | `permissions.write` |

The agent runs in a network-isolated sandbox (AWF) with only the read token.
Even if the agent were compromised or prompt-injected, it cannot perform write
operations. Write actions are only executed in Stage 3 (`SafeOutputs`)
after threat analysis, using a completely separate token that the agent never
sees.

#### Creating the Service Connections

1. **Navigate** to **Project Settings → Service connections → New service connection**
2. Choose **Azure Resource Manager → Service principal (automatic)** (or manual if
   your organization requires it)
3. Create two connections:

   **Read connection** (e.g., `ado-agent-read`):
   - Scope: subscription or resource group level
   - Grants: the ability to mint read-only ADO-scoped tokens
   - Used by: the agent job to call `az account get-access-token` with the
     ADO resource ID (`499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798`)

   **Write connection** (e.g., `ado-agent-write`):
   - Scope: subscription or resource group level
   - Grants: the ability to mint read-write ADO-scoped tokens
   - Used by: the executor job to create PRs, work items, etc.

4. **Reference them** in your agent front matter:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     read: ado-agent-read
     write: ado-agent-write
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> `permissions.write` is **optional**. The Stage 3 executor always has a
> write-capable token available via `$(System.AccessToken)` (the pipeline's
> built-in OAuth token, running as *Project Collection Build Service*). Configure
> `permissions.write` only when you need cross-org writes or named-identity
> attribution — it overrides the default token with an ARM-minted credential.

#### Permission Combinations

| Configuration | Agent can read ADO? | Safe outputs can write? |
|---|---|---|
| Both `read` + `write` | ✅ | ✅ (via ARM-minted token) |
| Only `read` | ✅ | ✅ (via `$(System.AccessToken)`) |
| Only `write` | ❌ | ✅ (via ARM-minted token) |
| Neither (default) | ❌ | ✅ (via `$(System.AccessToken)`) |

### Step 4: Authorize the Pipeline

On the first run, Azure DevOps will prompt you to authorize the pipeline to use
the service connections. Approve the permissions and the pipeline is ready.

## Agent File Reference

### Front Matter Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **required** | Human-readable name for the agent |
| `description` | string | **required** | One-line summary of the agent's purpose |
| `target` | `standalone` \| `1es` \| `job` \| `stage` | `standalone` | Pipeline output format. `job` and `stage` generate reusable ADO YAML templates rather than complete pipelines. |
| `engine` | string or object | `copilot` | Engine identifier or object with `id`, `model`, `timeout-minutes`, etc. |
| `on` | object | — | Unified trigger configuration (`schedule`, `pipeline` completion, `pr` triggers). See [schedule syntax](#schedule-syntax). |
| `pool` | string or object | `vmImage: ubuntu-22.04` (standalone) / `AZS-1ES-L-MMS-ubuntu-22.04` (1ES) | Agent pool |
| `workspace` | `root` \| `repo` \| `self` \| *alias* | auto | Working directory mode. `self` is an alias for `repo`; any checked-out repo alias is also accepted. |
| `repos` | list | — | Compact repository declarations (replaces legacy `repositories:` + `checkout:`) |
| `mcp-servers` | map | — | MCP server configuration |
| `tools` | object | — | Tool configuration (`bash`, `edit`, `cache-memory`, `azure-devops`) |
| `runtimes` | object | — | Runtime environment configuration (`lean`, `python`, `node`, `dotnet`) |
| `parameters` | list | — | ADO runtime parameters surfaced in the pipeline queue UI |
| `permissions` | object | — | ARM service connections (`read`, `write`) |
| `safe-outputs` | object | — | Per-tool configuration |

| `post-steps` | list | — | Inline steps after agent runs |
| `setup` | list | — | Separate job before agentic task |
| `teardown` | list | — | Separate job after safe outputs |
| `network` | object | — | Additional allowed/blocked hosts |
| `inlined-imports` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, resolves all `{{#runtime-import …}}` markers at compile time; the generated YAML is self-contained but prompt-body edits require recompilation. See [runtime-imports.md](docs/runtime-imports.md). |
| `env` | map | `{}` | Workflow-level environment variables (accepted by parser, not yet forwarded to compiled pipeline output) |
| `execution-context` | object | — | Configuration for the always-on execution-context plugin (`aw-context/` contributors). See [execution-context.md](docs/execution-context.md). |

| `ado-aw-debug` | object | — | Debug-only knobs for local/dogfood diagnostics. See [ado-aw-debug.md](docs/ado-aw-debug.md). |

### Markdown Body

Everything below the front matter `---` fence is the agent's instructions. Write
natural language describing the task, constraints, and expected behavior.

---

## Schedule Syntax

The `on.schedule` field uses a fuzzy syntax that deterministically scatters
execution times based on the agent name, preventing load spikes.

The expressions below are the value of the `schedule:` key under `on:`. For
example:

```yaml
on:
  schedule: daily around 14:00
```

```yaml
# Daily
on:
  schedule: daily                          # Scattered across 24 hours
on:
  schedule: daily around 14:00             # Within ±60 min of 2 PM
on:
  schedule: daily between 9:00 and 17:00   # Business hours

# Weekly
on:
  schedule: weekly on monday around 9:00   # Monday morning

# Multi-day / Special periods
on:
  schedule: every 2 days                   # Every 2 days at scattered time
on:
  schedule: every 2 weeks                  # Every 14 days at scattered time
on:
  schedule: bi-weekly                      # Every 14 days at scattered time
on:
  schedule: tri-weekly                     # Every 21 days at scattered time

# Hourly / Minute intervals
on:
  schedule: hourly                         # Every hour, scattered minute
on:
  schedule: every 2h                       # Every 2 hours (valid: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12)
on:
  schedule: every 15 minutes               # Fixed, not scattered

# With timezone
on:
  schedule: daily around 14:00 utc+9       # 2 PM JST → 5 AM UTC

# With branch filtering
on:
  schedule:
    run: daily around 14:00
    branches:
      - main
      - release/*
```

## MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give the agent access to external tools.

### Built-in Tools (via `tools:`)

First-class integrations are configured under the `tools:` front matter field —
not under `mcp-servers:`. The compiler auto-generates all required pipeline steps
and network allowlist entries.

```yaml
tools:
  # Bash command allow-list. Omit or use [":*"] for unrestricted access;
  # set to [] to disable bash entirely. See docs/tools.md.
  bash: ["git status", "git diff", "npm test"]

  # File editing tool (read/write/patch files in the workspace). Default: true.
  edit: true

  # Azure DevOps MCP — query work items, repos, PRs, etc.
  azure-devops: true

  # With scoping options
  azure-devops:
    toolsets: [repos, wit]
    allowed: [wit_get_work_item, repo_list_repos_by_project]
    org: myorg               # Optional — inferred from git remote by default

  # Persistent memory across agent runs
  cache-memory: true

  # With options
  cache-memory:
    allowed-extensions: [.md, .json]
```

### Custom MCP Servers (via `mcp-servers:`)

For external or third-party MCPs, use the `mcp-servers:` field. Each entry is
either a **containerized stdio server** (Docker-based) or an **HTTP server**
(remote endpoint). All traffic routes through the MCP Gateway (MCPG).

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  # Docker container stdio MCP
  my-tool:
    container: "node:20-slim"
    entrypoint: "node"
    entrypoint-args: ["path/to/mcp-server.js"]
    # enabled: set to false to temporarily disable without removing the entry
    # args: additional Docker runtime arguments inserted before the image name
    #   (e.g. ["--memory", "512m"]).  Dangerous flags like --privileged trigger
    #   a compile-time warning.
    args: []
    # mounts: volume mounts in "source:dest:mode" format
    mounts:
      - "/host/data:/app/data:ro"
    # env: environment variables for the MCP container process.
    #   Use "" (empty string) as the value to forward the variable from the
    #   pipeline environment (passthrough); supply a literal string for static
    #   values.
    env:
      MY_SECRET: ""          # passthrough from pipeline env
      STATIC_VALUE: "hello"  # literal value
    allowed:
      - search
      - analyze

  # Remote HTTP MCP
  remote-api:
    url: "https://mcp.example.com/api"
    headers:
      X-MCP-Toolsets: "repos,wit"
    allowed:
      - wit_get_work_item
```

Custom MCP containers run inside the AWF network sandbox. Add any required
external domains to `network.allowed`.

---

## Safe Outputs

Safe outputs are the only way agents produce side effects. The agent proposes
actions, and the executor processes them after threat analysis.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create-pull-request` | Creates a PR from the agent's code changes |
| `create-work-item` | Creates an ADO work item (Task, Bug, etc.) |
| `comment-on-work-item` | Adds a comment to an existing ADO work item |
| `update-work-item` | Updates fields on an existing ADO work item |
| `create-wiki-page` | Creates a new Azure DevOps wiki page |
| `update-wiki-page` | Updates the content of an existing wiki page |
| `add-pr-comment` | Adds a comment thread on a pull request |
| `reply-to-pr-comment` | Replies to an existing PR review comment thread |
| `resolve-pr-thread` | Resolves or updates the status of a PR review thread |
| `submit-pr-review` | Submits a review vote on a pull request |
| `update-pr` | Updates pull request metadata (reviewers, labels, auto-complete, vote, update-description) |
| `link-work-items` | Links two ADO work items together |
| `queue-build` | Queues a pipeline build by definition ID |
| `create-git-tag` | Creates a git tag on a repository ref |
| `create-branch` | Creates a new branch from an existing ref |
| `add-build-tag` | Adds a tag to an ADO build |
| `upload-build-attachment` | Attaches a file to a build (accessible via REST API or custom extension only) |
| `upload-pipeline-artifact` | Publishes a file as a pipeline artifact visible in the ADO Artifacts tab |
| `upload-workitem-attachment` | Uploads a workspace file as an attachment to a work item |
| `report-incomplete` | Reports that a task could not be completed |
| `noop` | Reports no action was needed |
| `missing-data` | Reports required data was unavailable |
| `missing-tool` | Reports a needed tool was missing |

### Example: Pull Request Configuration

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
    target-branch: main
    draft: false             # PRs are drafts by default; set false to publish immediately (required for auto-complete)
    auto-complete: true
    delete-source-branch: true
    squash-merge: true
    reviewers:
      - "reviewer@example.com"
    labels:
      - automated
    work-items:
      - 12345
```

### Example: Work Item Configuration

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-work-item:
    work-item-type: Bug
    area-path: "MyProject\\MyTeam"
    assignee: "developer@example.com"
    tags:
      - agent-created
      - needs-triage
```

### Manual Review (`require-approval`)

High-impact safe outputs can be gated behind a human approval step. When the agent proposes a gated action, the pipeline inserts a `ManualValidation` step between Detection and SafeOutputs. A reviewer must approve before the output is applied.

Set `require-approval: true` per tool, or use the detailed form for approvers and timeout:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
    target-branch: main
    require-approval: true          # Gate this tool behind manual review
  create-work-item:
    work-item-type: Task
    require-approval:
      approvers: ["my-ado-group"]        # Optional: who can approve (empty = anyone with run access)
      notify-users: ["lead@example.com"] # Optional: who receives a notification email
      timeout-minutes: 1440              # Optional: 24h; default = ADO job/stage limit
      on-timeout: reject                 # "reject" (fail-closed, default) or "resume" (auto-approve)
      instructions: "Review carefully before approving."
```

See [`docs/safe-outputs.md`](docs/safe-outputs.md) for the full reference.

## Network Isolation

Agents run inside [AWF (Agentic Workflow Firewall)](https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall)
containers with L7 domain whitelisting. Only explicitly allowed domains are
reachable. The allowlist is built from:

1. **Core domains** — Azure DevOps, GitHub, Microsoft auth, Azure storage
2. **MCP domains** — automatically added per enabled MCP
3. **User domains** — from `network.allowed` in front matter
4. **Minus blocked** — `network.blocked` entries are removed from the
   combined allowlist. Both ecosystem identifiers (e.g. `python`) and raw
   domain strings are supported. Blocking an ecosystem identifier removes
   all of its domains; blocking a raw domain uses exact-string matching
   (blocking `"github.com"` does **not** also remove `"*.github.com"`).

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - "*.mycompany.com"
    - "api.external-service.com"
  blocked:
    - "analytics.tracking.com"
```

- `ado-aw secrets list` — list variable names and flags on every matched definition. Never prints values.
- `ado-aw secrets delete <name>` — delete a pipeline variable from every matched definition.

All three accept `--all-repos` / `--source <path>` for project-scope (Preview-driven) discovery instead of local-fixture matching. See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for the full flag reference.

### Using Prompts with Your AI Agent

Paste the raw URL into your coding agent's chat:

```text
Create an ADO agentic workflow using
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/ado-aw/main/prompts/create-ado-agentic-workflow.md

The purpose of the workflow is to <describe what you want>
```

The AI agent will fetch the prompt, follow its instructions, and create a complete workflow file for you.
