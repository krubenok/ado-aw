# Update an Azure DevOps Agentic Workflow

Modify an existing **ado-aw** agent file — a markdown document with YAML front matter that the `ado-aw` compiler transforms into a secure, multi-stage Azure DevOps pipeline. Read the **entire** agent file before making any changes.

---

## Modes

**Interactive mode** — ask the user what they want to change, confirm each modification, and explain any side-effects (e.g., adding `permissions.write` when cross-org writes or named-identity attribution is needed).

**Non-interactive mode** — apply the requested changes directly, validate the result, and report what was changed and why.

In both modes, follow the update workflow below.

---

## Update Workflow

### Step 1 — Read the Existing File

Read the full agent markdown file. Identify:

- **Front matter fields** currently set (name, description, engine, schedule, pool, target, workspace, etc.)
- **MCP servers** configured and their `allowed:` lists
- **Safe outputs** enabled and their configuration
- **Permissions** (`read` / `write` / both / neither)
- **Repositories and checkout** configuration
- **Steps** (setup, teardown, steps, post-steps)
- **Network** allow/blocked lists
- **Agent instructions** (the markdown body after the closing `---`)

Do not proceed until you understand the current state.

### Step 2 — Make Targeted Changes

Modify **only** what the user requests. Do not refactor unrelated sections, reorder fields, or rewrite the agent instructions unless asked.

When adding new fields, place them in the conventional front matter order:

```
name → description → target → engine → workspace → pool →
repos → tools → runtimes → mcp-servers → safe-outputs →
on (schedule + triggers) → execution-context → steps → post-steps → setup → teardown → network →
permissions → supply-chain → parameters
```

> **`on.pr` knob update**: when changing `on.pr.branches` or
> `on.pr.paths`, also confirm whether `mode` (default `synthetic`) is
> appropriate. In `synthetic` mode the compiler emits a Setup-job ADO
> REST call to discover the open PR for `Build.SourceBranch` and
> leaves the top-level `trigger:` at the ADO default. Switch to
> `mode: policy` only if the operator has explicitly installed a
> Build Validation branch policy — that mode emits `trigger: none`
> and drops the synth wiring. Reference:
> [`docs/front-matter.md#pr-triggering-in-azure-repos`](../docs/front-matter.md#pr-triggering-in-azure-repos).

### Step 3 — Validate the Changes

Run through the validation checklist (see below) before finalizing. Fix any issues and inform the user of corrections made.

When you have local CLI access, two read-only commands give a quick
structural sanity check **before** you recompile or hand off to the
user:

```bash
# Compact summary of jobs, stages, steps, output decls, derived dependsOn
ado-aw inspect path/to/agent.md

# Resolved dependency graph (text by default; --format dot pipes to Graphviz)
ado-aw graph dump path/to/agent.md
```

These build the typed IR from the source and answer "did my change
add/remove the expected jobs?" and "did the output / dependency wiring
end up where I expected?" without writing any YAML to disk. The audit
docs in [`docs/audit.md`](../docs/audit.md) and the IR JSON contract
in [`docs/ir.md`](../docs/ir.md#public-json-summary-irsummary) cover
the underlying `PipelineSummary` schema if you want to script against
the JSON form.

### Step 4 — Recompile (if needed)

After any **front matter** changes, the pipeline YAML must be regenerated:

```bash
ado-aw compile <path/to/agent.md>
```

> **Important**: Changes to the **markdown body** (agent instructions) do **not** require recompilation — the agent reads its instructions from the source `.md` file at runtime. **Exception**: if `inlined-imports: true` is set in the front matter, the body is embedded at compile time, so body edits also require `ado-aw compile`. Check the front matter before advising the user.

---

## What Requires Recompilation

| Change | Recompile? |
|---|---|
| Any YAML front matter field | **Yes** — run `ado-aw compile` |
| Agent instructions (markdown body) | **No** — loaded at runtime (unless `inlined-imports: true`) |
| Adding/removing safe outputs | **Yes** |
| Changing schedule | **Yes** |
| Adding/removing MCP servers | **Yes** |
| Updating permissions | **Yes** |
| Editing the agent's task description | **No** (unless `inlined-imports: true`) |
| Adding steps / post-steps / setup / teardown | **Yes** |
| Changing network allow/blocked lists | **Yes** |

---

## Common Update Scenarios

### Adding a Safe Output Tool

Example: adding `comment-on-work-item` to an existing workflow.

1. Add the safe output configuration to the front matter:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  # ... existing safe outputs ...
  comment-on-work-item:
    max: 3
    target: "MyProject\\MyTeam"   # Required — scoping policy
```

2. Optionally set `permissions.write` if you need cross-org writes or a named identity (not required — the executor defaults to `$(System.AccessToken)`):

```yaml
permissions:
  write: my-write-arm-connection
```

3. Update the agent instructions to explain when and how to use the new tool.

4. Recompile: `ado-aw compile <path/to/agent.md>`

### Changing the Schedule

Example: changing from daily to weekly.

```yaml
# Before
on:
  schedule: daily around 14:00

# After
on:
  schedule: weekly on monday around 9:00
```

The fuzzy schedule syntax scatters execution time deterministically based on the agent name hash. The actual cron time will be within ±60 minutes of the specified time.

**Schedule quick reference:**

| Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `daily around 14:00` | Within ±60 min of 2 PM UTC |
| `weekly on monday` | Every Monday, scattered time |
| `weekly on friday around 17:00` | Friday ~5 PM UTC |
| `hourly` | Every hour, scattered minute |
| `every 2h` | Every N hours (valid: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12) |
| `every 3 days` | Every N days, scattered time |
| `every 2 weeks` | Every N weeks (converted to N×7 days) |
| `bi-weekly` | Every 14 days |
| `tri-weekly` | Every 21 days |
| `daily between 9:00 and 17:00` | Business hours |

Append `utc+N` or `utc-N` for timezone conversion: `daily around 9:00 utc-5`

To schedule on branches other than `main`, use the object form:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    run: weekly on monday around 9:00
    branches:
      - main
      - release/*
```

Recompile after any schedule change.

### Adding an MCP Server

Example: adding the first-class `azure-devops` tool.

```yaml
tools:
  azure-devops: true
  # Or with scoping:
  # azure-devops:
  #   toolsets: [repos, wit]
  #   allowed: [wit_get_work_item, core_list_projects]
  #   org: myorg
```

When adding `azure-devops`, also ensure:

- `permissions.read` is set (the agent needs a token to query ADO APIs)
- The compiler auto-adds ADO-specific hosts to the network allowlist

For custom containerized MCP servers:

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  my-tool:
    container: "node:20-slim"
    entrypoint: "node"
    entrypoint-args: ["path/to/server.js"]
    allowed:
      - do_thing
      - get_status
```

Specifying an explicit `allowed:` list for custom MCPs is **strongly recommended** — without it, all tools from that server are accessible to the agent. Add any required external domains to `network.allowed`.

### Adding Permissions

Example: enabling read-only ADO API access for the agent.

```yaml
permissions:
  read: my-read-arm-connection
```

| Config | Effect |
|---|---|
| `read` only | Agent can query ADO APIs; executor writes via `$(System.AccessToken)` (default) |
| `write` only | Agent has no ADO API access; executor writes via the ARM-minted token |
| Both | Agent can read; executor writes via the ARM-minted token |
| Neither | Agent has no ADO API access; executor writes via `$(System.AccessToken)` |

`permissions.write` is **optional** — the Stage 3 executor defaults to `$(System.AccessToken)`. Set it only when you need cross-org writes or named-identity attribution instead of `Project Collection Build Service`.

### Enabling GitHub App-backed Copilot Auth

Add a `github-app-token` block under `engine:` so Copilot authenticates with an
org-backed GitHub App installation token (Copilot engine only):

```yaml
engine:
  id: copilot
  github-app-token:
    app-id: 1234567       # literal App ID or client ID
    owner: octo-org       # installation owner (org or user)
    # repositories: [octo-repo]        # optional; scopes the token
    # api-url: https://ghe.example.com/api/v3   # optional; GHES
    # private-key: MY_SECRET_VAR       # optional; defaults to GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
    # skip-token-revocation: false     # optional; token is revoked by default
```

Then store the private key as a secret:
```bash
ado-aw secrets set GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY "$(cat app-private-key.pem)"
```

Notes: this is distinct from `permissions:` (ADO API tokens) — it only sources
the Copilot engine's `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Compile prints a non-blocking advisory
reminding you to mark the private-key variable secret. See
[`docs/engine.md`](../docs/engine.md#github-app-backed-copilot-engine-auth).
Requires recompilation.

### Adding Pre/Post Steps

**Inline steps** run inside the `Agent` job:

```yaml
steps:               # BEFORE agent runs
  - bash: echo "Preparing context..."
    displayName: "Prepare context"

post-steps:          # AFTER agent completes
  - bash: echo "Processing outputs..."
    displayName: "Post-process"
```

**Separate jobs** run before/after the entire pipeline:

```yaml
setup:               # Separate job BEFORE Agent
  - bash: echo "Provisioning..."
    displayName: "Setup"

teardown:            # Separate job AFTER SafeOutputs
  - bash: echo "Cleanup..."
    displayName: "Teardown"
```

### Updating Agent Instructions

Changes to the markdown body (after the closing `---`) do **not** require recompilation. The agent reads its instructions from the source `.md` file at runtime.

> **Exception**: if `inlined-imports: true` is set in the front matter, the body is embedded into the pipeline YAML at compile time. In that case, body edits **do** require `ado-aw compile`. Always check the front matter for this field before advising the user.

When updating instructions:

- Preserve the existing structure unless the user asks for a rewrite
- If new safe-output tools were added, explain when the agent should use them
- If new MCP servers were added, describe the new capabilities available
- Keep instructions concise — the agent reads them on every execution

---

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any update, verify:

1. **Write permissions**: The Stage 3 executor defaults to `$(System.AccessToken)` — `permissions.write` is only needed for cross-org writes or named-identity attribution (e.g., attributing PRs to a specific service account rather than `Project Collection Build Service`).

2. **MCP allow-lists**: Custom MCP servers (with `container:` or `url:`) have explicit `allowed:` lists.

3. **Schedule syntax**: The schedule expression uses valid fuzzy schedule syntax. Valid frequencies: `daily`, `weekly on <day>`, `hourly`, `every Nh`, `every N minutes`, `every N days`, `every N weeks`, `bi-weekly`, `tri-weekly`. Valid time specs: `around HH:MM`, `between HH:MM and HH:MM`.

4. **Repository aliases**: Every repo alias used in agent instructions or safe-output `repository:` fields exists as an entry in `repos:` with `checkout: true` (the default).

5. **Workspace consistency**: If `workspace: repo` is set, ensure `repos:` has at least one additional repository with `checkout: true`. If only `self` is checked out, `workspace: repo` is unnecessary (the compiler warns about this).

6. **Network domains**: If new MCPs or external services are added, ensure required domains are in `network.allowed`.

7. **Target compatibility**: Both `standalone` and `1es` targets support containerized MCPs via MCPG.

8. **Safe output `target` fields**: `comment-on-work-item` requires an explicit `target` field. `update-work-item` fields require explicit opt-in (`status: true`, `title: true`, etc.).

9. **Parameter names**: Runtime `parameters:` names must be valid ADO identifiers.

10. **Engine model**: If `engine:` only sets the default `copilot` engine with model `claude-opus-4.7` and no other settings (timeout, `github-app-token`, `provider`, etc.), the `engine:` field can be omitted entirely.

## Example: Before and After

### Before — simple scheduled agent

```markdown
---
name: "Code Review Bot"
description: "Reviews open PRs for common issues"
on:
  schedule: daily around 10:00
permissions:
  read: my-read-sc
---

## Instructions

Review all open pull requests and leave comments on any issues found.
```

### After — adding work item creation and weekly schedule

```markdown
---
name: "Code Review Bot"
description: "Reviews open PRs for common issues and creates tracking work items"
on:
  schedule: weekly on monday around 10:00
permissions:
  read: my-read-sc
  write: my-write-sc
safe-outputs:
  create-work-item:
    work-item-type: Bug
    tags:
      - automated
      - code-review
    max: 5
---

## Instructions

Review all open pull requests and leave comments on any issues found.

### When Issues Are Found

For each significant issue, create a work item using `create-work-item` with:
- A clear title describing the issue
- A description with the PR link, file path, and explanation

### When No Issues Are Found

Use `noop` with a summary of what was reviewed.
```

**Changes made:**
1. Updated `description` to reflect new capability
2. Changed `schedule` from `daily` to `weekly on monday`
3. Optionally added `permissions.write` (only needed for cross-org writes or named-identity attribution; the executor defaults to `$(System.AccessToken)`)
4. Added `safe-outputs.create-work-item` configuration
5. Updated agent instructions to describe when to create work items

**Recompilation required**: Yes — front matter was modified.

---

## Output Instructions

After completing an update:

1. **Summarize changes** — list each front matter field that was added, modified, or removed.
2. **Note recompilation** — state whether `ado-aw compile` is needed.
3. **Flag validation issues** — report any checklist items that were auto-corrected.
4. **Provide next steps**:

  1. Review the changes in <filename>.md
  2. Recompile: ado-aw compile <path/to/agent.md>
  3. Commit both the updated .md source and regenerated .lock.yml pipeline
```

If only agent instructions were changed (and `inlined-imports: true` is **not** set):

```
Next steps:
  1. Review the changes in <filename>.md
  2. Commit the updated .md file (no recompilation needed)
```

If only agent instructions were changed but `inlined-imports: true` **is** set:
