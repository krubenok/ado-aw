//! Registry of ado-script Node bundles and their compile-time env contracts.
//!
//! Every compiler-emitted pipeline step that runs an ado-script bundle
//! (`/tmp/ado-aw-scripts/ado-script/<name>.js`) has an implicit environment
//! contract: which `process.env` keys the bundle reads. Historically each
//! call site hand-wrote that step's `env:` block, which is how the Conclusion
//! step drifted and shipped without an ADO bearer token (issue #1307 — the
//! shared `getWebApi()` auth helper had no `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN`).
//!
//! This module makes the **auth** half of that contract explicit and
//! enforceable:
//!
//! * [`Bundle`] enumerates every bundle, with its on-disk [`Bundle::path`] and
//!   its [`Bundle::auth`] requirement.
//! * [`apply_bundle_auth`] is the single chokepoint that projects
//!   `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN` into a step for every bearer-requiring bundle, so no
//!   call site can forget it again.
//! * [`token_source_for`] unifies the `System.AccessToken` vs `SC_WRITE_TOKEN`
//!   selection that was previously duplicated between the Conclusion job and
//!   the Stage 3 executor.
//!
//! ## What is *not* modelled here
//!
//! The ADO collection URI is read from the **auto-injected**
//! `SYSTEM_COLLECTIONURI` (see `scripts/ado-script/src/shared/auth.ts` and
//! #1307), so it is not part of any step's env contract. Likewise every ADO
//! predefined variable (`System.*`, `Build.*`) is auto-injected into every
//! script step's env under its SCREAMING_SNAKE name, so bundle steps must not
//! re-project them — [`is_redundant_ado_mirror`] identifies such redundant
//! mirrors and the contract test asserts migrated steps do not emit them.
//! `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN` is the one documented exception: ADO maps it only when
//! a step explicitly references it, which is exactly what [`apply_bundle_auth`]
//! does.
