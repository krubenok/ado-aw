//! Single always-on extension that delivers and runs ado-script bundles
//! (gate.js, import.js) inside the ADO pipeline.
//!
//! Two features, each emitted into the job that actually consumes the
//! bundle:
//!
//! - **Gate evaluator (`gate.js`)** — runs in the **Setup job** when
//!   `filters:` lowers to non-empty checks.
//! - **Runtime-import resolver (`import.js`)** — runs in the **Agent
//!   job** when `inlined-imports: false`.
//!
//! ## Why per-job emission
//!
//! ADO jobs use isolated VMs — `/tmp` is **not** shared. The
//! `ado-script.zip` bundle is therefore downloaded once per consuming
//! job. When both features are active, install + download steps appear
//! in **both** Setup and Agent. That's correct architecture given ADO's
//! topology, not waste.

/// a value containing shell metacharacters cannot break out or trigger command
/// substitution.
///
