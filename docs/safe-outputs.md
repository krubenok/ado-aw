# Safe Outputs Configuration & Tool Reference

_Part of the [ado-aw documentation](../AGENTS.md)._

> ℹ️ The debug-only `create-issue` tool (used by dogfood pipelines to file
> failure reports back to GitHub) is **not** a safe output and is not
> configurable here. It is gated by a separate `ado-aw-debug:` front-matter
> section and stripped from the SafeOutputs MCP server unless explicitly
> enabled. See [`docs/ado-aw-debug.md`](ado-aw-debug.md).

## Safe Outputs Configuration

The front matter supports a `safe-outputs:` field for configuring specific tool behaviors:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-work-item:
    work-item-type: Task
    assignee: "user@example.com"
    tags:
      - automated
      - agent-created
  create-pull-request:
    target-branch: main
    draft: false             # default is true; set false to publish immediately (required for auto-complete)
    auto-complete: true
    delete-source-branch: true
    squash-merge: true
    reviewers:
      - "user@example.com"
    labels:
      - automated
      - agent-created
    work-items:
      - 12345
```

Safe output configurations are passed to Stage 3 execution and used when processing safe outputs.

### Manual review (`require-approval`)

High-impact safe outputs can be gated behind a human approval step
(`ManualValidation@1`) that pauses the run until a reviewer approves or rejects
in the Azure DevOps UI. This lets agents propose more consequential actions
(PRs, branches, queued builds, work items) safely.

Set `require-approval` at the **section level** for a pipeline-wide default,
and/or inside an **individual tool** to override the default for that tool:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  require-approval: true          # global default: every output below needs review
  create-pull-request:
    target-branch: main
  add-pr-comment:
    require-approval: false       # …except low-impact comments, which auto-apply
```

`require-approval` accepts either a bare boolean or an object for finer control:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
    require-approval:
      approvers: ["[MyOrg]\\release-team"]   # who may approve (empty → anyone with run permission)
      notify-users: ["ops@example.com"]      # who is emailed (empty → no email)
      timeout-minutes: 120                    # pending period before on-timeout fires (omit → pipeline default)
      on-timeout: reject                      # reject (default, fail-closed) | resume
      instructions: "Verify the proposed PR before approving."
```

Resolution per tool: the tool's own `require-approval` wins; otherwise the
section-level `require-approval` applies; otherwise the tool is **not** gated.

**Defaults (bare `require-approval: true`)** — the run pauses on a Review panel;
**anyone with run permission** can approve or reject; **no** notification emails
are sent; and the validation **fails closed** on timeout (`on-timeout: reject`),
so un-approved outputs are never applied.

**Timeout (`timeout-minutes` / `on-timeout`)** — `timeout-minutes` bounds the
`ManualValidation@1` task's pending period; when it elapses the task applies
`on-timeout` (`reject` by default, or `resume` to auto-approve). The agentless
`ManualReview` job carries a slightly larger outer timeout as a hard bound, so a
job-level cancellation never preempts the task's graceful `on-timeout` handling
(in particular, `on-timeout: resume` reliably auto-approves rather than being
cancelled). Omit `timeout-minutes` to inherit the pipeline default.

**Reviewer message** — set `instructions` to control the text shown in the
Review panel and notification emails. It is plain text and supports pipeline
variable (`$(...)`) interpolation. When omitted, ado-aw generates a default
message listing the reviewed safe-output type(s) awaiting approval. A run uses a
**single** `ManualReview` gate covering every reviewed tool: the gate message
**lists every reviewed tool** and aggregates **all** author-supplied per-tool
`instructions` (grouped when identical), so no tool's note is dropped when
several are gated. A single reviewed tool with its own `instructions` shows that
message verbatim; set `instructions` on the section-level `require-approval` to
apply one note to every tool.

**Execution shape** — manual review changes the compiled pipeline:

- A new agentless `ManualReview` job (`pool: server`) runs `ManualValidation@1`
  between Detection and the safe-output execution.
- It only pauses when Detection cleared the run (no prompt-injection / secret
  leak) **and** the agent actually proposed a reviewed-type output (a Detection
  step sets a `HasReviewedProposals` flag) — so the run never pauses for
  nothing.
- When some tools are gated and others are not, execution **splits**: an
  automatic `SafeOutputs` job applies the non-gated outputs immediately
  (independent of the review outcome), while a separate `SafeOutputs_Reviewed`
  job — gated behind `ManualReview` — applies the approved outputs and publishes
  a distinct `safe_outputs_reviewed` artifact. A rejected or timed-out review
  fails closed: the reviewed job is skipped while the automatic outputs are
  unaffected.
- When **every** configured tool requires approval (no automatic tools),
  execution is **not** split — the single `SafeOutputs` job is gated behind
  `ManualReview` in its entirety. Note this also defers the always-enabled
  diagnostic outputs (`noop`, `report-incomplete`, `missing-tool`,
  `missing-data`) until after approval, since they share that one job. If you
  want diagnostics to apply without waiting on a human, leave at least one
  low-impact tool (e.g. `add-pr-comment`) non-gated so the automatic split job
  is created.

The Detection threat gate always runs first, so a flagged run applies nothing —
automatic or reviewed.

### Safe-outputs summary tab

Every run that proposes safe outputs publishes a human-readable **build summary
tab** titled **`ado-aw-safe-outputs`**, listing what the agent proposed. This is
always on — it does **not** require `require-approval` — so non-elevated runs get
the same transparency, and it is the panel a reviewer reads before approving a
gated run.

- The summary is rendered at the **end of the Agent job** (the job that produced
  the proposals) by the `approval-summary` ado-script bundle, and attached via
  `##vso[task.uploadsummary]`. It is **not** produced by the Detection
  (threat-analysis) stage, whose only job is inspecting proposals for threats.
- Each proposal is shown with per-tool key fields (e.g. PR title + target branch,
  work-item title) plus a truncated excerpt of any long body. All content is
  **agent-generated** and is sanitized for display (markdown/HTML escaped, code
  fences neutralised, control characters stripped, long values truncated) so a
  proposal cannot forge UI or break the layout.
- When manual review is configured, the **pending-approval** proposals are listed
  first (under a `⏳ Pending approval` heading), followed by the automatic ones.
  With no approval configured, a single list is shown. The default review
  message points approvers at this tab.
- Rendering is best-effort: if it fails it is logged as a warning and never fails
  the build or blocks the review gate.

**Coexistence with your own summary tabs.** ADO derives a summary section's title
from the uploaded file's base name and does not de-duplicate, so this feature uses
a namespaced base name (`ado-aw-safe-outputs.md` → the `ado-aw-safe-outputs`
section). It is additive and build-scoped: it appears as one extra section
alongside any `task.uploadsummary` tabs your own steps publish (including under
`target: job` / `target: stage`), and never collides with them.

### Executor authentication

All write-bearing safe outputs (e.g. `create-pull-request`,
`create-work-item`, `add-pr-comment`, `upload-build-attachment`) run in the
Stage 3 `SafeOutputs` job and authenticate to Azure DevOps using
`SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN`. By default this is `$(System.AccessToken)` — the
pipeline's built-in OAuth token running as the *Project Collection Build
Service* identity. Set `permissions.write` to override this with an
ARM-minted token, e.g. for cross-org writes or named-identity attribution.
See [`docs/network.md`](network.md) and
[`docs/ir.md`](ir.md) for the typed SafeOutputs job wiring.

## Available Safe Output Tools

### comment-on-work-item
Adds a comment to an existing Azure DevOps work item. This is the ADO equivalent of gh-aw's `add-comment` tool.

**Agent parameters:**
- `work_item_id` - The work item ID to comment on (required, must be positive)
- `body` - Comment text in markdown format (required, must be at least 10 characters)

**Configuration options (front matter):**
- `max` - Maximum number of comments per run (default: 1)
- `include-stats` - Whether to append agent execution stats to the comment body (default: true)
- `target` - **Required** — scoping policy for which work items can be commented on:
  - `"*"` - Any work item in the project (unrestricted, must be explicit)
  - `12345` - A specific work item ID
  - `[12345, 67890]` - A list of allowed work item IDs
  - `"Some\\Path"` - Work items under the specified area path prefix (any string that isn't `"*"`, validated via ADO API at Stage 3)

**Example configuration:**
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  comment-on-work-item:
    max: 3
    target: "4x4\\QED"
```

**Note:** The `target` field is required. If omitted, compilation fails with an error. This ensures operators are intentional about which work items agents can comment on.

### create-work-item
Creates an Azure DevOps work item.

**Agent parameters:**
- `title` - A concise title for the work item (required, must be more than 5 characters)
- `description` - Work item description in markdown format (required, must be more than 30 characters)
- `tags` - Tags to apply to the work item (optional list; each tag must not contain a semicolon). May be subject to the `allowed-tags` allowlist. Merged with any static `tags` configured in front matter.

**Configuration options (front matter):**
- `work-item-type` - Work item type (default: "Task")
- `area-path` - Area path for the work item
- `iteration-path` - Iteration path for the work item
- `assignee` - User to assign (email or display name). When omitted, falls back to the email of the last person who committed changes to the agent source markdown file (discovered via `git log` at Stage 3).
- `tags` - Static list of tags always applied to the work item (regardless of agent input)
- `allowed-tags` - Allowlist of tags the agent is permitted to use via the `tags` parameter. If empty, any agent-provided tags are accepted. Supports `*` wildcards anywhere in the pattern (e.g., `"agent-*"` matches `"agent-created"`; `"copilot:repo=org/project/*@main"` matches any repo name).
- `custom-fields` - Map of custom field reference names to values (e.g., `Custom.MyField: "value"`)
- `max` - Maximum number of create-work-item outputs allowed per run (default: 1)
- `include-stats` - Whether to append agent execution stats to the work item description (default: true)
- `artifact-link` - Configuration for GitHub Copilot artifact linking:
  - `enabled` - Whether to add an artifact link (default: false)
  - `repository` - Repository name override (defaults to BUILD_REPOSITORY_NAME)
  - `branch` - Branch name to link to (default: "main")

### update-work-item
Updates an existing Azure DevOps work item. Each field that can be modified requires explicit opt-in via configuration to prevent unintended updates.

**Agent parameters:**
- `id` - Work item ID to update (required, must be a positive integer)
- `title` - New title for the work item (optional, requires `title: true` in config)
- `body` - New description in markdown format (optional, requires `body: true` in config)
- `state` - New state (e.g., `"Active"`, `"Resolved"`, `"Closed"`; optional, requires `status: true` in config)
- `area_path` - New area path (optional, requires `area-path: true` in config)
- `iteration_path` - New iteration path (optional, requires `iteration-path: true` in config)
- `assignee` - New assignee email or display name (optional, requires `assignee: true` in config)
- `tags` - New tags, replaces all existing tags (optional, requires `tags: true` in config)

At least one field must be provided for update.

**Configuration options (front matter):**
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  update-work-item:
    status: true              # enable state/status updates via `state` parameter (default: false)
    title: true               # enable title updates (default: false)
    body: true                # enable body/description updates (default: false)
    markdown-body: true       # store body as markdown in ADO (default: false; requires ADO Services or Server 2022+)
    title-prefix: "[bot] "    # only update work items whose title starts with this prefix
    tag-prefix: "agent-"      # only update work items that have at least one tag starting with this prefix
    max: 3                    # maximum number of update-work-item outputs allowed per run (default: 1)
    target: "*"               # Required — "*" allows any work item ID, or set to a specific work item ID number
    area-path: true           # enable area path updates (default: false)
    iteration-path: true      # enable iteration path updates (default: false)
    assignee: true            # enable assignee updates (default: false)
    tags: true                # enable tag updates (default: false)
    allowed-tags: []          # Optional — restrict which tags the agent can set (empty = any; supports * wildcards anywhere in the pattern, e.g. "agent-*" or "copilot:repo=org/project/*@main")
```

**Note:** The `target` field is required. If omitted, compilation fails with an error. This ensures operators are intentional about which work items agents can update.

**Security note:** Every field that can be modified requires explicit opt-in (`true`) in the front matter configuration. If the `max` limit is exceeded, additional entries are skipped rather than aborting the entire batch.

### create-pull-request
Creates a pull request with code changes made by the agent. When invoked:
1. Generates a patch file from `git diff` capturing all changes in the specified repository
2. Saves the patch to the safe outputs directory
3. Creates a JSON record with PR metadata (title, description, source branch, repository)

During Stage 3 execution, the repository is validated against the allowed list (from `checkout:` + "self"), then the patch is applied and a PR is created in Azure DevOps.

**Shallow-clone agent pools (automatic):** The diff base for the patch is
computed at agent time from the checked-out `self` repository. On agent pools
whose default git fetch is shallow (`fetchDepth: 1`), a bare `checkout: self`
leaves no `origin/<target-branch>` ref, which would otherwise prevent the diff
base from being computed. To handle this transparently, whenever
`create-pull-request` is configured the compiler emits a credentialed
**prepare step** in the Agent job (before the agent runs) that fetches and
progressively deepens the configured `target-branch` and points
`origin/HEAD` at it. This means create-pull-request works on shallow-default
pools **without** forcing a full-history `checkout: self` and **without**
hand-editing the compiled lock (so the runtime integrity check keeps passing).
No configuration is required. See [`docs/ado-script.md`](ado-script.md)
(`prepare-pr-base.js`).

```

This hybrid approach combines:
- **Git worktree + apply**: Correct patch application using git's battle-tested diff parser
- **ADO REST API**: No git config (user.email/name) needed, authentication handled via token

**Agent parameters:**
- `title` - PR title (required, 5-200 characters)
- `description` - PR description in markdown (required, 10+ characters)
- `repository` - Repository to create PR in: "self" for pipeline repo, or alias from `checkout:` list (default: "self")
- `labels` - Labels to add to the PR (optional; validated against `allowed-labels` when configured)

Note: The source branch name is auto-generated from a sanitized version of the PR title plus a unique suffix (e.g., `agent/fix-bug-in-parser-a1b2c3`). This format is human-readable while preventing injection attacks.

**Configuration options (front matter):**
- `target-branch` - Target branch to merge into (default: "main")
- `draft` - Whether to create the PR as a draft (default: **true**). Set to `false` to publish the PR immediately. **Note:** `auto-complete` is silently skipped on draft PRs — set `draft: false` when using `auto-complete: true`.
- `auto-complete` - Set auto-complete on the PR (default: false). Requires `draft: false` to take effect.
- `delete-source-branch` - Delete source branch after merge (default: true)
- `squash-merge` - Squash commits on merge (default: true)
- `title-prefix` - Optional string prepended to all PR titles created by this agent (e.g., `"[Bot] "`)
- `if-no-changes` - Behavior when the agent's patch produces no file changes: `"warn"` (default, succeed with a warning), `"error"` (fail the step), `"ignore"` (succeed silently)
- `max-files` - Maximum number of files allowed in a single PR (default: 100). PRs exceeding this limit are rejected.
- `protected-files` - Controls whether manifest/CI files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `.github/`, `*.lock`) can be modified: `"blocked"` (default, reject changes to these files) or `"allowed"` (permit all files)
- `excluded-files` - Glob patterns for files to strip from the patch before applying (e.g., `["*.lock", "dist/**"]`)
- `allowed-labels` - Allowlist of labels the agent is permitted to apply. If empty (default), any labels are accepted.
- `reviewers` - List of reviewer emails to add
- `labels` - List of labels to apply
- `work-items` - List of work item IDs to link
- `fallback-record-branch` - When PR creation fails, record the pushed branch name and target branch in the failure response so operators can manually create the PR (default: true)
- `max` - Maximum number of create-pull-request outputs allowed per run (default: 1)
- `include-stats` - Whether to append agent execution stats (token usage, duration, model) to the PR description (default: true)

**Multi-repository support:**
When `workspace: root` and multiple repositories are checked out, agents can create PRs for any allowed repository:
```json
{"title": "Fix in main repo", "description": "...", "repository": "self"}
{"title": "Fix in other repo", "description": "...", "repository": "other-repo"}
```
The `repository` value must be `"self"`, an alias from the `checkout:` list in the front matter, the full Azure DevOps repository name (e.g. `project/repo`), or the bare repository name (case-insensitive, e.g. `sdk-FtdiDeviceControl` for an entry whose ADO name is `4x4/sdk-FtdiDeviceControl`).

    max: 1                       # Maximum per run (default: 1)
```

### upload-build-attachment

Attaches a workspace file to an Azure DevOps build as a **build attachment** via
the ADO build attachments REST API
(`PUT /_apis/build/builds/{buildId}/attachments/{type}/{name}`).

> **Important:** Build attachments are **not visible** in the standard Azure
> DevOps build summary UI. They are only accessible via the REST API or through
> a custom Azure DevOps extension that registers a tab matching the
> `attachment-type` value. For artifacts that should appear in the **Artifacts
> tab**, use [`upload-pipeline-artifact`](#upload-pipeline-artifact) instead.

**Omit `build_id` to target the current pipeline run** — the executor resolves
the build ID from the `BUILD_BUILDID` environment variable automatically. When
`build_id` is provided, the file is attached to that specific build — useful for
posthumously decorating a finished build with a generated report, screenshot, or
log bundle.

The tool stages the file during Stage 1 (MCP) by copying it into the
safe-outputs directory; Stage 3 reads the staged copy and uploads it via the REST
API.

**Agent parameters:**
- `build_id` *(optional)* - Target build ID. Omit to attach to the current pipeline run. Must be positive when specified.
- `artifact_name` - Attachment name (1–100 chars, alphanumeric / `-` / `_` / `.`, no leading `.`)
- `file_path` - Relative path to the file in the workspace (no directory traversal)

**Configuration options (front matter):**
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  upload-build-attachment:
    max-file-size: 52428800              # Maximum file size in bytes (default: 50 MB)
    allowed-extensions: []               # Optional — restrict file types (e.g., [".png", ".pdf", ".log"])
    allowed-artifact-names: []           # Optional — restrict names (suffix `*` = prefix match)
    allowed-build-ids: []                # Optional — restrict target builds (skipped when targeting current build)
    name-prefix: ""                      # Optional — prepended to the agent-supplied artifact name
    attachment-type: "agent-artifact"    # Optional — {type} segment in the attachments URL (default: "agent-artifact")
    max: 3                               # Maximum per run (default: 3)
```

**Notes:**
- Single-file only; directory uploads are not supported.
- When `build_id` is omitted and `allowed-build-ids` is configured, the allow-list check is skipped — the current build is implicitly trusted.

**About `attachment-type`:** This is the `{type}` segment in the ADO build
attachments URL (`PUT .../attachments/{type}/{name}`). It acts as a category
label. Azure DevOps extensions can register to display attachments of a specific
type — for example, the built-in code coverage extension displays attachments
with type `CodeCoverageSummary`. The default `agent-artifact` is a custom type;
without a matching ADO extension installed, attachments with this type are only
accessible via the REST API. Change this only if you have a custom extension
that displays attachments of a specific type. Most users should use
[`upload-pipeline-artifact`](#upload-pipeline-artifact) for user-visible
artifacts instead.

### upload-pipeline-artifact

Publishes a workspace file as an Azure DevOps **pipeline artifact** that appears
in the **Artifacts tab** of the build summary page. Uses the ADO build artifacts
REST API in two steps:

1. **Upload bytes** to the agent's own per-build file container (Azure DevOps
   creates one container per build and exposes its ID via `BUILD_CONTAINERID`).
2. **Associate** the artifact record (`name = artifact_name`) with the target
   build via `POST /{project}/_apis/build/builds/{effective_build_id}/artifacts`.

**Omit `build_id` to target the current pipeline run** — the executor resolves
the build ID from the `BUILD_BUILDID` environment variable automatically. When
`build_id` is provided, the artifact record is published to that specific build
("cross-build publishing"). The artifact bytes still live in the agent's own
build container; only the record's pointer is associated with the target build.
This means cross-published artifacts share the agent build's retention — if the
agent's build is purged, the cross-referenced artifact stops being downloadable.
Cross-project publishing is not supported (the associate POST uses the current
pipeline's project).

The tool stages the file during Stage 1 (MCP) by copying it into the
safe-outputs directory; Stage 3 reads the staged copy and executes the two-step
REST flow.

**Agent parameters:**
- `build_id` *(optional)* - Target build ID. Omit to publish to the current pipeline run. Must be positive when specified.
- `artifact_name` - Artifact name shown in the Artifacts tab (1–100 chars, alphanumeric / `-` / `_` / `.`, no leading `.`)
- `file_path` - Relative path to the file in the workspace (no directory traversal)

**Configuration options (front matter):**
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  upload-pipeline-artifact:
    max-file-size: 52428800              # Maximum file size in bytes (default: 50 MB)
    allowed-extensions: []               # Optional — restrict file types (e.g., [".png", ".pdf", ".log"])
    allowed-artifact-names: []           # Optional — restrict names (suffix `*` = prefix match)
    allowed-build-ids: []                # Optional — restrict target builds (skipped when targeting current build)
    name-prefix: ""                      # Optional — prepended to the agent-supplied artifact name
    require-unique-names: false          # Optional — see "Reusing artifact names" below
    max: 3                               # Maximum per run (default: 3)
```

**Reusing artifact names within one agent run:**
By default, the same `artifact_name` may be reused across multiple
`upload-pipeline-artifact` calls in one run (e.g. publishing a `TriageSummary`
to many failing builds at once). The executor inserts a short hash suffix
(`{artifact_name}__{6 hex}`) into the **internal container folder name** so
the calls don't silently overwrite each other's bytes in the agent's shared
build container. The hash lives only in internal addressing — it does not
appear in the `record.name` your downstream consumers query for, in the web UI
"Download as zip" filename, or in the contents of files extracted by the
`DownloadBuildArtifacts@1` / `DownloadPipelineArtifact@2` tasks (all of which
strip the container folder prefix).

Set `require-unique-names: true` to use a clean container folder
(`{artifact_name}` only, no suffix) and reject in-run reuse of
`(effective_build_id, artifact_name)` with a clear early error before any HTTP
call. Use this when you guarantee one artifact per name per run and want the
shortest possible internal addressing.

Two records with the same `name` on the **same** target build still collide at
the record level (ADO returns 409 from the associate call) regardless of this
setting; use distinct `artifact_name` values when targeting one build with
multiple uploads.

**Notes:**
- Single-file only; directory uploads are not supported.
- When `build_id` is omitted and `allowed-build-ids` is configured, the allow-list check is skipped — the current build is implicitly trusted.
- Requires `BUILD_CONTAINERID`, `BUILD_BUILDID`, and `SYSTEM_TEAMPROJECTID` (all set automatically inside an Azure DevOps pipeline job) and `vso.build_execute` scope on the executor's token (granted to `$(System.AccessToken)` by default, and to the ARM-minted token when `permissions.write` is set).

### cache-memory (moved to `tools:`)
Memory is now configured as a first-class tool under `tools: cache-memory:` instead of `safe-outputs: memory:`. See the [Cache Memory section](./tools.md#cache-memory-cache-memory) in `docs/tools.md` for details.

### create-wiki-page
Creates a new Azure DevOps wiki page. The page must **not** already exist; the tool enforces an atomic create-only operation (via `If-Match: ""`). Attempting to create a page that already exists results in an explicit failure.

**Agent parameters:**
- `path` - Wiki page path to create (e.g. `/Overview/NewPage`). Must not be empty and must not contain `..`.
- `content` - Markdown content for the wiki page (at least 10 characters).
- `comment` *(optional)* - Commit comment describing the change. Defaults to the value configured in the front matter, or `"Created by agent"` if not set.

**Configuration options (front matter):**
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-wiki-page:
    wiki-name: "MyProject.wiki"     # Required — wiki identifier (name or GUID)
    wiki-project: "OtherProject"    # Optional — ADO project that owns the wiki; defaults to current pipeline project
    branch: "main"                  # Optional — git branch override; auto-detected for code wikis (see note below)
    path-prefix: "/agent-output"    # Optional — prepended to the agent-supplied path (restricts write scope)
    title-prefix: "[Agent] "        # Optional — prepended to the last path segment (the page title)
    comment: "Created by agent"     # Optional — default commit comment when agent omits one
    max: 1                          # Maximum number of create-wiki-page outputs allowed per run (default: 1)
    include-stats: true             # Append agent stats to wiki page content (default: true)
```

Note: `wiki-name` is required. If it is not set, execution fails with an explicit error message.

**Code wikis vs project wikis:** The executor automatically detects code wikis (type 1) and resolves the published branch from the wiki metadata. You only need to set `branch` explicitly to override the auto-detected value (e.g. targeting a non-default branch). Project wikis (type 0) need no branch configuration.

### update-wiki-page
Updates the content of an existing Azure DevOps wiki page. The wiki page must already exist; this tool edits its content but does not create new pages.

**Agent parameters:**
- `path` - Wiki page path to update (e.g. `/Overview/Architecture`). Must not be empty and must not contain `..`.
- `content` - Markdown content for the wiki page (at least 10 characters).
- `comment` *(optional)* - Commit comment describing the change. Defaults to the value configured in the front matter, or `"Updated by agent"` if not set.

**Configuration options (front matter):**
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  update-wiki-page:
    wiki-name: "MyProject.wiki"     # Required — wiki identifier (name or GUID)
    wiki-project: "OtherProject"    # Optional — ADO project that owns the wiki; defaults to current pipeline project
    branch: "main"                  # Optional — git branch override; auto-detected for code wikis (see note below)
    path-prefix: "/agent-output"    # Optional — prepended to the agent-supplied path (restricts write scope)
    title-prefix: "[Agent] "        # Optional — prepended to the last path segment (the page title)
    comment: "Updated by agent"     # Optional — default commit comment when agent omits one
    max: 1                          # Maximum number of update-wiki-page outputs allowed per run (default: 1)
    include-stats: true             # Append agent stats to wiki page content (default: true)
```

Note: `wiki-name` is required. If it is not set, execution fails with an explicit error message.

**Code wikis vs project wikis:** The executor automatically detects code wikis (type 1) and resolves the published branch from the wiki metadata. You only need to set `branch` explicitly to override the auto-detected value (e.g. targeting a non-default branch). Project wikis (type 0) need no branch configuration.
